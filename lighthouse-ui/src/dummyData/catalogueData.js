It can miss fine structures, hallucinates small disconnected components at times, and does not produce boundaries as crisply as more computationally intensive methods that “zoom-in”, e.g. [18]. In general, we expect dedicated interactive segmentation methods to outperform SAM when many points are provided, e.g. [67]. Unlike these methods, SAM is designed for generality and breadth of use rather than high IoU interactive segmentation. Moreover, SAM can process prompts in real-time, but nevertheless SAM's overall performance is not real-time when using a heavy image encoder. Our foray into the text-to-mask task is exploratory and not entirely robust, although we believe it can be improved with more effort. While SAM can perform many tasks, it is unclear how to design simple prompts that implement semantic and panoptic segmentation. Finally, there are domain-specific tools, such as [7], that we expect to outperform SAM in their respective domains.",
